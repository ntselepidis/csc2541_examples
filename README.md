# CSC2541 Code Examples

This repository will contain JAX example code for my topics course, [CSC2541: Neural Net Training Dynamics](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc2541_2021/). So far, it contains an implementation of the original K-FAC algorithm, as well as the sensitivity analysis from Lecture 2. Additional examples from Chapters 2 and 3 will be added soon.
